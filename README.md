Ouija Checker is a scanning program designed to sort through old lists of amplification reflectors
and determine if the vulnerable services running on the endpoint is still able to be leveraged.

Known bugs: doesn't break well with CTRL+C. You gotta spam it a few times. Whenever I decide to
be less lazy I'll come back and fix it. Works flawlessly other than that.

Cheers.
